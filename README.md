## üê± Abstract
<font color="red">ParaDiffusion</font> an information-enriched diffusion model for paragraph-to-image generation task, which delves into the transference of the extensive semantic comprehension capabilities of large language models to the task of image generation. At its core is using a large language model (e.g., Llama V2) to encode long-form text, followed by fine-tuning with LORA to align the text-image feature spaces in the generation task. A high-quality paragraph-image pair dataset, namely ParaImage is proposed to facilitate the training of long-text semantic alignment.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Paragraph-Image Dataset: ParaImage-Small

![image.](asset/images/WX20231124-120329@2x.png)

The proposed ParaImage dataset mainly includes two parts:

(a) ParaImage-Big: High-quality images with generative captions (ParaImage-Big) are primarily employed for the paragraph-image alignment learning in Stage 2.

(b) ParaImage-Small: Aesthetic images with manual long-term description (ParaImage- Small) are primarily used for quality-tuning in Stage 3.

**ParaImage-Small** is a few thousand high-quality images are thoughtfully selected from LAION-Aesthetics, adhering to common principles in photography, then professionally annotated by skilled annotators.


The ParaImage-Small can be download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12x0uS0KgD4_NqzJ1A7hLjGkPIwD1Ozud/view?usp=drive_link)




## ‚úèÔ∏è New Prompts Eval: ParaPrompts-400

The current test prompts focus on short text-to-image generation, ignoring the evaluation for paragraph-to-image generation, we introduced a new evaluation set of prompts called ParaPrompts, including 400 long-text descriptions.

The previous prompts testing was mostly concentrated on text alignments within the range of 0-25 words, while our prompts extend to long-text alignments of 100 words or more.
